  <h1>Butterflies</h1>
 <p>Butterflies are an insect that live anywhere from 2 days to as long as 11 months. They go through a four-step process called metamorphosis &#8211; from egg, to caterpillar, to chrysalis to a butterfly. Keep reading for more interesting butterfly facts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Butterflies are insects, but large scaly wings set them apart. These wings allow them to fly but only when their body temperature is above 86 degrees.</li>
<li>The fastest butterflies can fly up to 30 miles per hour.</li>
<li>Scientists estimate that there are 28,000 species of butterflies throughout the world.</li>
<li>Most butterflies are found in tropical rainforests, but they can live in all climates and altitudes of the world.</li>
<li>The butterfly does migrate to avoid cold weather.</li>
<li>Many believe butterflies got their name because they would fly around the buckets of milk on farms. While the milk was being churned into butter, many noticed these flying insects would appear and soon they were being called butterflies.</li>
<li>Butterflies have three body parts, like all other <a href="https://kidskonnect.com/browse/subject/insects/">insects</a>: the head, the thorax (chest), and the abdomen (bottom). The butterfly&#8217;s four wings and six legs are attached to the thorax.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>More about them</h1>
  <ul>
  	<li>Butterflies are colorful for many reasons. The colors help them attract a mate and absorb heat and the color also helps them blend in among the flowers when they are feeding.</li>
<li>Butterflies change four times during their lives in a process which is called metamorphosis. They are born as an egg (stage 1). Next they turn into a caterpillar, or larvae (stage 2). This caterpillar will eat constantly &#8211; it loves leaves and flowers &#8211; and will grow and grow through this stage of its life.</li>
<li>As the caterpillar grows, it skin will spilt and molt or shed its skin. When the caterpillar has grown several thousand times its original size, it goes into a resting stage. This is when the caterpillar becomes a pupa, or chrysalis (stage 3).</li>
<li>Finally, the chrysalis breaks open and a butterfly comes out (stage 4). Now the adult butterfly will begin the process all over again by laying eggs of its own.</li>
<li>Most butterflies live on the nectar and pollen from flowers.</li>
<li>Butterflies have a long, flexible, tube-like tongue that goes down into the nectar of the flower. They suck the nectar up through this tongue.</li>
<li>Female butterflies are usually larger than males and they live longer.</li>
<li>Butterflies can live anywhere from 2 days to 11 months.</li>
</ul>

  <h1>How it feels to be a butterfly</h1>
  <p>The birds are so lucky. They can fly to any place they want. I wish I could fly. I wish I were a butterfly. Butterflies are so beautiful. There are so many colours on butterflies’ body. I cannot believe that they are natural colours. It looks like beautiful paintings. If I were a butterfly I would sit on the most beautiful flower. Butterflies are lucky because their food is so sweet – honey. Wow! I can eat something sweet whenever I am hungry. I will fly from one flower to another like we play hop-scotch. I will sleep on a bed of flowers. Life will be so beautiful like a dream. I can visit so many places. I would like my body to be red in colour and my wings should have all the colours of the rainbow. My friends will be jealous of my beauty. Oh! How I wish I were a butterfly</p>
